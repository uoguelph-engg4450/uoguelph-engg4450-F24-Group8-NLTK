# Dataset Licenses

This document provides a grouped summary of licenses for data packages present in the [`nltk_data`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data) repository, based on the current `index.xml` file. Each package is cited by its exact `id` and `name`, and grouped by license type as declared in the metadata.

Packages with ambiguous, missing, or unclear licensing are listed in a dedicated section and explicitly noted. If a license is present but not a recognized open license, or is ambiguous, this is also noted.

_Note: While this list is generated carefully and covers all packages found in the current `index.xml`, it may not be exhaustive or fully accurate—users are responsible for verifying licensing details for their own use cases, especially for commercial or redistributive use._

## Unclarified, Unknown, or Ambiguous License

The following packages have no `license` attribute, an empty value, a citation request instead of a license, or otherwise ambiguous status.  
**_Treat these as unclarified unless clarified by upstream or additional documentation!_**

> **Note:** Despite long-standing and ongoing community efforts—witnessed through several open issues in both the [`nltk`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues) and [`nltk_data`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data/issues) GitHub repositories—no clarification has yet been possible for these packages. The most notable case is the Punkt Tokenizer Models, but many others remain unresolved. The project continues to seek clarification, but users should exercise particular caution.
