# LICENSE-OVERVIEW.md

## Overview

This repository, [`nltk_data`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data), is governed as a whole by the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). However, **the individual data packages included in this repository are subject to a wide variety of licenses**, which are not always the same as the repository-wide license. Many datasets are covered by permissive open licenses (MIT, Creative Commons, etc.), some are public domain, and others are distributed with custom terms or with explicit restrictions (e.g., non-commercial use only, distributed with permission, or educational use only).

**It is essential to consult the specific license for each dataset before use, particularly for commercial or redistributive purposes.**  
A comprehensive, grouped list of licenses for each data package is provided in [DATASET-LICENSES.md](DATASET-LICENSES.md).

## Special Notes

- **Unclarified and Ambiguous Licenses:**  
  Several data packages have ambiguous, missing, or unclarified licenses (notably, the Punkt Tokenizer Models). Despite long-standing community efforts documented in both the [`nltk`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues) and [`nltk_data`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data/issues) repositories, clarification has not always been possible. These packages are grouped and highlighted in [DATASET-LICENSES.md](DATASET-LICENSES.md).  
  If you have legal questions or concerns about using any package with an unclear or ambiguous license, you should consult a qualified legal professional. Open-source developers and maintainers are not able to provide legal advice.

- **Repository License:**  
  All code and repository-level content is provided under the Apache License 2.0 unless otherwise noted.

- **Data Package Licenses:**  
  Each data package may have its own license, as detailed in [DATASET-LICENSES.md](DATASET-LICENSES.md). These may include:
  - Open source licenses (MIT, various Creative Commons, GPL, etc.)
  - Public domain
  - Custom or restrictive terms ("distributed with permission", "non-commercial use only", "see website", etc.)
  - Citation requests in lieu of a license
  - Explicitly unclarified or missing terms

## Your Responsibilities

- **Check the Dataset License:**  
  Before using, modifying, or redistributing any data package, **read the relevant license entry in [DATASET-LICENSES.md](DATASET-LICENSES.md)** and consult upstream sources if your use case is sensitive.

- **When in Doubt:**  
  If the license is missing, ambiguous, or does not suit your intended use, do not assume that commercial or public redistribution is allowed. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer or legal professional; open-source project maintainers cannot provide legal guidance.
